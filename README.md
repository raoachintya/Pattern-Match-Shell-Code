# Pattern-Match-Shell-Code
This repository contains two files namely: Pattern which is a shell file and a text file that has some text in it. In our case the text file has a small story.

Motive :- We take an input from the user and then we let the user know if the word exists in the text file. If it does then we print found else otherwise.

To use it:-

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go the shell file's diretory.
3. Then run ./pattern.sh
4. Note :- If required change the directory in shell file.
